Implement the pybaseball api to create and evaluate a batter vision metric. This metric (VSA) is calculated using 
each batter's total for strikes swung at, strikes taken, balls swung at, and balls taken. In short, attempt to 
quantify how well a batter is seeing pitches that are either inside or outside the strike zone and swinging at 
them accordingly. VSA will be plotted against other standard metrics such as Batting Average (BA) and Pitches per 
Plate Appearance (Pit/PA).
